# TOOLS

<!-- ============================================================
  PENFIELD TEMPLATE — What belongs here

  This file is for local environment notes that help the agent
  use tools correctly. Think of it as "cheat sheet for my setup."

  Good things to put here:
  - Device names, SSH hosts, camera names
  - Preferred TTS voices, speaker/room names
  - API quirks specific to your deployment
  - Non-Penfield plugin notes and conventions

  DO NOT put Penfield-specific instructions here. The plugin's
  own SKILL.md handles that automatically. Adding Penfield notes
  here just wastes tokens on duplicate instructions.
  ============================================================ -->

## Local Environment

<!-- Replace these examples with your actual setup details. -->

<!-- Example entries (delete and replace with yours):
- SSH: `ssh myserver` (alias configured in ~/.ssh/config)
- Home Assistant: http://homeassistant.local:8123
- Preferred TTS voice: "alloy"
- Camera: "front_door" = Reolink on 192.168.1.50
-->

## Plugin Notes

<!-- Notes about non-Penfield plugins you have installed.
     For example, if you use a home automation plugin,
     weather plugin, calendar plugin, etc. -->
